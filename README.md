# castfastreceiver
Google Cast Receiver for my applications, although it is a Custom Web Receiver, it is based on the Google sample.
This project is not licensed at all.
The code is not private, at least I have not privatized it.
However, all the code that is not mine belongs to Google LLC, who develops Google Cast and its technology, I only use the SDK according to their policies and licenses. In short, although this project is mine, the code is from Google and I use it only for my applications and tests.
